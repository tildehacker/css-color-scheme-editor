# css-color-scheme-editor
An easy way to visually edit all colors in a CSS file.

## Motivation
While working on a webapp, I needed to edit the color scheme of a CSS file:
The CSS file is already compiled, a few colors are used but used many times.
Editing this file by hand and visualising every hex color code was a heavy task, so I made this script to help me do that.

## Installation
I will add a detailed installation guide.
For the techies, install `npm`, `bower` and `python` dependencies.

## How to use
```bash
./cse.sh SOURCE_CSS_FILE DEST_CSS_FILE
```
